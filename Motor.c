// *******Lab 13 solution*******

// ------------Motor_Init------------
// Initialize GPIO pins for output, which will be
// used to control the direction of the motors and
// to enable or disable the drivers.
// The motors are initially stopped, the drivers
// are initially powered down, and the PWM speed
// control is uninitialized.
// Input: none
// Output: none
void Motor_Init(void){
  // write this as part of Lab 13
  
}

// ------------Motor_Stop------------
// Stop the motors, power down the drivers, and
// set the PWM speed control to 0% duty cycle.
// Input: none
// Output: none
void Motor_Stop(void){
  // write this as part of Lab 13
  
}

// ------------Motor_Forward------------
// Drive the robot forward by running left and
// right wheels forward with the given duty
// cycles.
// Input: leftDuty  duty cycle of left wheel (0 to 14,998)
//        rightDuty duty cycle of right wheel (0 to 14,998)
// Output: none
// Assumes: Motor_Init() has been called

  // write this as part of Lab 13
  
}

// ------------Motor_Right------------
// Turn the robot to the right by running the
// left wheel forward and the right wheel
// backward with the given duty cycles.
// Input: leftDuty  duty cycle of left wheel (0 to 14,998)
//        rightDuty duty cycle of right wheel (0 to 14,998)
// Output: none
// Assumes: Motor_Init() has been called

}

// ------------Motor_Left------------
// Turn the robot to the left by running the
// left wheel backward and the right wheel
// forward with the given duty cycles.
// Input: leftDuty  duty cycle of left wheel (0 to 14,998)
//        rightDuty duty cycle of right wheel (0 to 14,998)
// Output: none
// Assumes: Motor_Init() has been called

// ------------Motor_Backward------------
// Drive the robot backward by running left and
// right wheels backward with the given duty
// cycles.
// Input: leftDuty  duty cycle of left wheel (0 to 14,998)
//        rightDuty duty cycle of right wheel (0 to 14,998)
